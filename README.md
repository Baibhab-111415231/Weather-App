# Weather App

This is a beginner-friendly Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.
Won't work though because i have removed my API from the code.
Clone the repo and add your own API key if ypou want to see it work.

If you want to make it work then generate you API key and put it in the 3rd line of script.js in place of "API Key".

## About Me

I'm just getting started with web development, and this is my second project.
Learned how to use API in this one.
P.S - It takes some time for the API key to get activated.
Excited to learn more and build bigger things soon!
